                <p>For the past decade, I have wonderful experience with Bentham Science Publisher (BSP). BSP is a famous platform for different disciplines of biomedical sciences, especially pharmaceutical science. As a Ph D of cancer pharmacology, most of my work is dedicated to the journals of BSP. I hope that we can have a life-long association.</p>

                <p>I am quite satisfied with publishing in Bentham journals, and especially in the microRNA journal. In an era of extreme and sometimes even unfair competition in scientific publication, microRNA has a very good record for enlisting competent and constructive editors and referees. I certainly hope the good work continues !

                <p>I wanted to take a few minutes to respond to your letter.  Working with the Bentham Science Editorial team has been a very rewarding experience for me.  I find the staff highly trained, organized and professional.  This experience has made it a pleasure to publish with Bentham Sciences because the support is so helpful.  Staff have been encouraging, patient and very detail oriented while helping me to fine-tune my manuscript(s) into their final format ready for public viewing.  Publishing is a challenge for me due to time constraints and a full-time teaching assignment but working with the Bentham Science group has been a pleasure.</p>

                <p>"My Experience of working and dealing with Bentham is beyond horizon and couldn't be expressed in few words. I like the instant reply and communications etiquette as well as respectful email messages. 
Actually, Bentham Journals are my favorite journals so I intend to submit my work to the highest reputable Publishers. I have 8 published articles as first author or coauthor in Bentham Journals. 
I am preparing two articles right now and I would like to extend my publications in Bentham Journals to approve my goals as a scientific researchers.</p>

                <p>Thank you for the email. The experience with Bentham Science Publication has been pleasant, upon submission we felt that the reviewers were expert in the field and respectful and provided good insight. Upon providing a second draft with the exact suggestions of the reviewers we did not encounter any obstacles and this resulted in the publication of the article. </p>

                <p>Thanks for your email. I definitely had a great time dealing with Bentham Science Publishers during the submission of the manuscript till its publication. Bentham Science Publishers keeps updating the status of the manuscript, and try to upgrade the quality of figures/photos in the article for readers. BSP does provide good service to the authors in the most convenient manner.</p>

                <p>Thank you for the opportunity of expressing my opinion about the services of Bentham Science Publishers. A submission platform has an objective configuration, allowing the submission of requested files for evaluation and viewing the status of the study.

                <p>It is an honour to be asked to write a few words about my experience of working with Bentham Science Publishers, ""Letters in Drug Design &#x0026; Discovery"".  It is one of the few journals that enables authors to publish quality research in an open format, with no page charges.</p>
                <p>Everyone that I have had to communicate with has been exceptionally helpful and thorough with their review and responses. I feel that the  Bentham Science Publication in general and LDDD in particular will go on to achieve a great impact in the publication society as a highly respected forum for accessing perfect quality manuscripts. I want to express my gratitude to the choice of excellent reviewers, who added valuable comments in order to get a better manuscript. I’m most grateful and appreciate Dr.Tabinda Rao Editorial Manager Publications of the journal for her replies to all of my questions quickly and directly and for being such a positive influence.</p>

                <p>My experience with Bentham Science Publishers’  "Current Alzheimer Research" was positive. While the review process of the manuscript was a bit too long, on the other hand the great contribution given by the Editor in Chief to the interpretation of the data I presented was brilliant. His suggestions have greatly improved the quality of my manuscript and so at the end my experience was very positive.</p>

                <p>Thank you for considering my opinion. I am very satisfied with your services. Everything went as scheduled and I received nice comments from the referees that helped me in improving my work. When submitting my work, the freedom to choose the charges we consider necessary, which may also end up with a free of charge publication, is very important for researchers from developing countries to get to our works published in nice journals as yours.</p>

                <p>I  have a great experience and feel proud to publish our paper with Bentham Science Publisher. I have published more than five publications in different journals including two publications in a well reputed journal "letters in organic chemistry" (LOC) without any hindrance and proper response by the concerned personnel.</p>

                <p>Thank you for contacting me. In regards to feedback on my experience working with this publisher, my only complaint is that the peer review process seemed to take longer than expected (about 2 months), and I received comments from 4 reviewers rather than the usual 2. Because each reviewer had several requests/questions, it took me a significant amount of time to make edits to the manuscript prior to re-submission. The online submission process was relatively straightforward. Your publication manager, Iqra Khalid, was very helpful and prompt in responding to my questions.</p>

                <p>"With years of experience in cooperation with Bentham Science Publishers, I can point out the exceptional professionalism, expediency and cordiality of your staff. These are the reasons why I will be happy to continue with publishing my research in your publications.</p>
                <p>

Taking into account the topic of research, unfortunately, I doubt it might be of interest to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology or the biomedical industry.</p>
                <p>

If I found that some of the projects, in which I am involved, might be of interest to you, I will certainly let you know."

                <p>Thank you so much for considering our work. I'm very happy with all the support from the Bentham Team. From the editor to the graphics team, everyone was very polite in their replies, meticulous in their work. Publishing an article was a daunting issue for me, but Bentham Science Publication "Current Aging Science" team made it easier and happier. Looking forward for more interactions.

                <p>"it has been a real pleasure to have worked with BSP.
This is not my first experience with  Bentham Science and I have always been happy to publish in your journals.
People from BSP are helpful, even if the work is hard for them sometimes . Many details are required and you have to have a rigorous correspondence with the authors, reviewers, editors and editorial assistants…to resend lost mails, to look for final acceptance  and publication of Special issues.</p>
                <p>
Nevertheless , the final product let you forget all the effort and we have been always very satisfied with it.
In conclusion, thanks for the opportunity you provided me and my co-worker Dr. Francesco Paolo Busardò to work with you and for you.

                <p>I have worked with Bentham for ten years and I believe that the high quality of their journals is worth highlighting. I am grateful especially to the journal Current Medicinal Chemistry for its very fast processing of revision and publication. I believe that my paper will be of interest to the researchers of many universities and the pharmaceutical, biotechnological and the biomedical industries.

                <p>I am highly obliged that Bentham accepted my manuscript and I got an opportunity to work with the same. I came across a lot of new things while doing the revision of my article and I think that would help me compose a much better article in future. Also, everything was done promptly like sending corrections, replying to my queries and so on, without any delay. No wonder, Bentham has such a good name in the field of publishers !</p>

                <p>I would like to sincerely thank you for your considerate services. The most impressive things of your services are detailed explanation and patience on my delay, while the only little deficiency is that the peer reviewing process takes a long time. In general, we are satisfied with your kind services, and I sincerely hope that we could have a good cooperation in the future too.
Once again, we appreciate you for the best possible services and products you provide.</p>

                <p>In my opinion contributing for Bentham Science was the best that I had experienced till now. You were too much supporting and speedy. I can't believe that the acceptance process had been performed in only 2 months. That is incredible</p>

                <p>Overall my work experience was good. I got prompt replies and guidance. I only faced difficulty in responding to reviewers comments as I had to make major revisions in my article and the time given was only 23 days. I have experience with other journals (Journal of Protein Chemistry for example)  and got 1 month for major revision with 15 days extension making a total of 45 days</p>

                <p>As far as I'm concerned, Bentham Science Publishers is really very professional, formal and rigorous. The processing of our manuscript is efficient and diligent which can be clearly seen from the review processes. And your services are much more comprehensive than many other publishers.</p>

                <p>I would like to thank the entire editing team of the Current Drug Delivery for their commitment to resolve all issues regarding the publication of my article. All sectors work in consonance and are quite agile. 
I believe that my work is of interest both in the pharmaceutical industry and in the biotechnology industry, since once the bioavailability of the active substance is guaranteed at its site of action, the better is the result for the patient. And so it is in the interest of the whole chain of health goods production, to encourage them to study this issue of biopharmaceutical stability in depth. 
At the moment I am working with ophthalmic release systems, which is still in progress. I look forward to future contributions to your journal.</p>

                <p>Thank you very much for your e-mail. In general I am very pleased to be one of the scientists to have published research in Anticancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry – Bentham Science. I can definitely tell that this was one of the best reviewing processes which I have experienced. The editors and Editorial Managers especially Noushaba Azhar was very kind and allowed us to express ourselves. </p>

                <p>Although RPME was not the highest ranked journal that I published in, but  my experience with this journal was the best among all the journals. Professor Zaman, who is the chief editor of the journal was the primary person responsible for this good experience along with the supporting staff of your publication.  There was no compromise on the quality as well. If you guys continue to work with this zeal, I am hopeful the publication will have a very bright future. Good luck!</p>

                <p>I have enjoyed very much working with Bentham Science Publishers. The reviewers and the editors, especially the editor in chief Prof. Mikhailidis, have been extremely helpful with their constructive comments, which have improved our paper considerably. Also, the author guidelines found on your website are very clear and easy to follow. The main reason why I chose your journal is that it is indexed in pubmed and medline, as well as in many other important databases. The only one missing, which could add real value to your journal, is science direct (http://www.sciencedirect.com); so this is the only thing that could be improved. Other than that, everything was perfect.</p>

                <p>"Thank you for your e-mail regarding our paper published in ""Mini-Reviews in Medicinal Chemistry"".
</p>
                <p>"While my association with Bentham Science Publishers both as an author and a reviewer has been for more than 10 years, however, this is my first paper in MRMC. I have published several articles in various journals of Bentham Science Publishers earlier and my publishing experiences have been excellent so far. Also, I have noted that over the years journals published by Bentham Science are playing a commendable role in disseminating information and knowledge particularly in the areas of Medical sciences. I shall certainly continue to submit my future research work to this or other appropriate journals of Bentham Science."</p>

</p>
                <p>
My experience with Bentham Science from submitting to finally acceptance of the article was great. I would specifically mention Ms. Noushaba Azher for her prompt reply to all my queries. Submission was quite easy and effortless. Also, the review process was hassle free, being direct, crisp and less time consuming. Keep up the good work!!!"</p>

                <p>Thank you for presenting us the opportunity to work with you. To interact with Bentham Science Publishers has been an experience in some words pleasant and other strenuous. I appreciate working with people who work for Bentham Science Publishers. I’ve realized that they are very busy and this makes their job more than respectable.</p>

                <p>I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to Bentham Science Publishers. I am highly impressed and thankful, for the amazing job you have done in bringing out to the world what had been an idea and a dream that will completely alter the course of diabetic medication. The editors and reviewers are extremely efficient. Any issues I have had, have been dealt with quickly, although publishing an article can be extremely stressful sometimes, they made the process easy.  It was a great experience.  I appreciated being kept up to date at every stage. I appreciated all the input I received. I am the novice here and you are the experts. Thank you very much.</p>

                <p>I would like to thank Bentham Science Publishers for their efficient handling of our recent manuscript in Current Medicinal Chemistry (CMC). The entire  review and editorial process were dealt with to our utmost satisfaction. In this connection, we would especially like to mention Ms Beenish Anwer for being so prompt and efficient in answering our queries and addressed some  unexpected issues that surfaced during the review process. The comments by all reviewers on the manuscript were constructive and focused which had helped improve the  presentation of the review article. I have published papers including reviews in many journals over the years, CMC should be ranked one the  best in terms of its editorial and publication processes. Thank you.</p>

                <p>I'd like to express my full support and satisfaction with your publication as a regular contributor considering the shortage of facilities in IRAN, it is important for me to be in touch with you. Also, I'd like to appreciate the quality of your services including evaluation of manuscripts, speedy proofs dispatch, etc.</p>

                <p>Bentham Science Publisher’s has always responded promptly to our queries. At the same time, we are disappointed with the long processing time of the manuscript. We retain that the delay in publication is not good for scientist curricula.</p>

                <p>We are thankful to the Bentham Science Publishers and its Reviewers for careful review of the manuscript and providing us with the constructive criticism and suggestions which greatly improved the quality of the manuscript. The reviews were fair and prompt which made us analyze our work more deeply. The scientific standard is very high, and the publication process has been smooth, efficient and of high standard. The editorial staff has always been very co-operative and gave a prompt reply to the e-mail conversations during the entire review process. Finally, we appreciate all the insightful comments of Bentham Science Publishers.</p>

                <p>It was an excellent experience to publish my work in Current Biotechnology. Both the EiC as well as the editorial staff responded directly to our questions and helped us a lot. The peer review process was rapid and efficient. The suggestions and remarks of the reviewers and the editorial staff helped us a lot to improve the manuscript. The journal is relatively new, and has to compete with a large number of online journals in the same field, but the dedication of the EiC and editorial staff, as well as the efficient reviewing and publishing process, will eventually make the difference. CBIOT has the potential to find a stable position (‘niche') within the number of high quality journals publishing articles in the field of biotechnology.</p>

                <p>My experience of working with Bentham Science Publishers, both as an editorial board member of the journal Current Aging Science, and as an editor of the eBook series Frontiers in Ageing Science, has been nothing but positive. The scientific standard is very high, the peer-review process is academically very strict, and the publication machinery has been smooth, efficient and of a high standard. The editorial staff has always been very co-operative, prompt and willing to deal with any problems. I wish them great, continuing success.</p>

                <p>It makes me really comfortable about the whole procedure of submitting our manuscript to "Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry". 
</p>
                <p>The editors are very nice and patient. I also appreciate Ms. Noushaba Azher. She replied to all of my questions quickly and clearly.
</p>
                <p>I hope I could have the opportunities to publish more research results in Bentham Science.
</p>
                <p>Thank you very much!

                <p>I have positive opinion of your work, cooperation and helpful suggestions. All the people with whom I have already had contact in Bentham Science Publishers have patience. They are helpful and very understanding. I feel comfortable to ask everything and the cooperation is at the highest level. They take care of every single piece of the submitted document, read it carefully, pointing unequivocally where and how to prepare the manuscript better. I have already recommended the organization and I will continue to share a positive attitude of the organization.</p>

                <p>It is my pleasure to disclose that i have a very pleasant experience with Bentham Science Publisher, one of the leading publishers in the scientific publications. Right from the article submission till publication, I found the entire process very smooth and looks that it is run and monitored by high-class professionals. 
</p>
                <p>I invite scientists around the world to publish their mechanistic research here and feel proud like me. Obviously, I would love to contribute and to have a regular connectivity with the publisher and journal.</p>

                <p>Concerning my latest submission to “Current Drug Delivery” of Bentham Science Publishers entitled “"Enhanced Periodontal Regeneration by Novel Single Application Sustained Release Nano-Structured Doxycycline Films”, I have seen many good points including excellent communication system, precision and highly professional peer reviewing in addition to the very appropriate time interval between submission and final acceptance.
</p>
                <p> Thank you for your efforts and looking forward to further cooperation with you.</p>

                <p>I have been working with Bentham Science Publishers for the last couple of years. I have contributed a couple papers to Current Organic Chemistry, Current Catalysis and Current Physical Chemistry. I am also associated with Current catalysis, Current Physical Chemistry, and Current Nanomaterials as Editorial Board Member or Regional Editor. I am extremely satisfied with the services of Bentham Science Publishers. 
</p>
                <p>I am very confident that Bentham is going to grow further in the coming years.</p>

                <p>Working with Bentham Science Publishers was a great experience. The entire process was very streamlined, right from uploading of the manuscript to the final proof. Our experience with the graphical department was also very satisfying, especially since the image enhancement charges were wavered off. We look forward to interacting with Bentham Science Publishers in the future as well.</p>

                <p>"Mini-Reviews in Medicinal Chemistry" is a good journal. When I submitted my manuscript, your response was prompt. My manuscript was proceeded for peer review instantly.
</p>
                <p>I appreciate your fast response. Your service is patient and considerable. If I have another review manuscript, I will submit it to your journal again.
</p>
                <p>Thank you so much for your best service once again.

                <p>I had a great time while working with MRMC. When the thematic issue 'Treatment and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and its complication: advanced approaches' was planned by myself and my colleague I got a very good support from the editorial staff members.  Especially support from <bold>Ms. Sara Arif and Ms. Mehwish Akhter</bold> was tremendous.
<bold>Wish the journal will achieve new high in future</bold>.</p>

                <p>The editorial staff and editor were great to work with.  They kept us up-to-date and informed about the status of our manuscript. The peer review  process was performed very efficiently and effectively.  The reviewers did an excellent job of identifying gaps and asking relevant questions that improved the quality of the manuscript. We were  very pleased with the quality of the reviews and the assistance of the reviewers. The journal has published overall good/high quality papers and is becoming recognized as an impactful resource for scientific thought and outcomes. Based on our experience as contributors to the journal and the quality of papers published in the journal, I would recommend to my colleagues that they strongly consider the journal for their future publications.</p>

Bentham Science Publishers right from the time of the submission of our research paper, 
“Enantioselective Hetero-Diels-Alder Reaction of Aromatic Aldehydes Catalyzed by ((R)-1,1´-Bi-2-naphthoxy)titanium Dichloride: Experimental and Theoretical Results” for publication in Current Catalysis up to its actual publication. It has been a very pleasant experience and i look forward to submitting our next research paper.</p>

                <p>To be in a rush to publish and to produce a high quality product are the two most important things that Bentham science has efficiently accomplished for me. The review process went smooth and easy. The post publishing services are remarkable. In total, it was an interesting experience.</p>

                <p>My experience during the publication process with Bentham Science was very positive The journal manager kept a constant check on the quality of the manuscripts and stimulated the authors to improve their work, facilitating the medical educational process. I indeed recommend scientists and researchers to publish their research articles in the prestigious journal ‘<bold>Recent Advances in DNA and Gene Sequences</bold>’ by Bentham Sciences Publishers.</p>

                <p>My publishing experience in Medicinal Chemistry (Bentham) was excellent. Genuine and professional peer-reviewing process; reasonably timed publication cycle; sending timely reminders; and the excellent editorial support even without asking. I also liked the indexing of this journal in almost all major databases; this will ensure good visibility to our work.</p>

                <p>My experience of working with Bentham Science Publication “Current Computer-Aided Drug Design” has been excellent. I was provided with all the necessary information, as well as friendly reminders within deadlines. The organization is very professional and I would be pleased to collaborate again with the journal in the future.</p>
                <p>I would also like to acknowledge the high level of everyone else who was responsible for the editing and processing of documents for the best final quality at the time of publication.</p>

                <p>I am very pleased with the quality of service that I received from every part of Bentham Science, including your journal, Current Drug Discovery Technologies. First, let me thank you and the editor for inviting me to submit a review article. The 2<sup>nd</sup> edition was written as a text for the first semester of the two semester course in medicinal chemistry that is taught in pharmacy schools around the world. Bentham Science is doing a great job of helping my books reach the market. </p>
                <p>At the same time, the article I wrote for Current Drug Discovery Technologies gave me an opportunity to reach a broader audience than the one that I reach in my research on food and natural products chemistry at the FDA. It also gave me the opportunity to review the very important subject of allo-network drugs, which has emerged recently and is described in more detail in the 3<sup>rd</sup> edition. The review process was fast and efficient. It caught the mistakes that I made and recommended several important improvements. The final proofs look excellent. </p>
                <p>The other thing that Bentham Science has done for me is to greatly increase my scientific reputation, which has led to several other publishers inviting me to write review articles for them. In conclusion, Bentham Science continues to support my career and I hope that you have found me to be a valuable contributor.</p>

                <p>“I am glad to have chosen Bentham Science Publishers to disseminate my work. The review process of Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering was swift, fair and - most importantly - open to an unconventional scientific development. Thus, rather than simply paying lip service, this journal truly provides a forum of cutting edge interdisciplinary research that has the potential of high practical significance."</p>

                <p>“I felt good with Current Biotechnology on the submission, review and publishing processes. My relationship with the editorial staff and the EiC was very positive. The publishing process was quick and professional. Reviewers' suggestions were helpful to improve our manuscript. I hope this journal will be more attractive to the researchers in biotechnology.” </p>

                <p>“This was my first submission to Current Biotechnology so, understandably, I was a bit apprehensive to try a new publisher. However, I was very pleased with the process and particularly the very kind and helpful interactions I had with the EiC and all of the members of the CBIOT team. The peer review process was thorough but also timely and the reviews improved the quality of the final manuscript. It is a great honour for me to have one of my papers published in this journal and I will certainly be submitting future manuscripts.”</p>

I appreciate the interaction at the end when important decisions had to be made, and the editors were helpful and accommodating. The peer review process was at a very acceptable rate.

                <p>The communication and information supply by the editorial staff and EiC was open, friendly, to the point, and fast. Also their help in getting the required adjustments to the figures done in an efficient way was very much appreciated. The peer review process was fast for the first review, but the response on my resubmission took longer.  The reviewers’ suggestions were helpful in improving the manuscript.  The overall quality and authority of the journal is good; good scientific papers in diverse fields of Biotechnology; the special issues with themes of current interest are also adding to the quality of the journal, and a reason to recommend it to colleagues.</p>

                <p>I am very satisfied of my collaboration with the journal <bold>Current Neuropharmacology</bold> and Bentham Science Publishers. I received constant support from the journal manager, when requested, and the production was rapid and efficient. Plus, the quality of the galley proofs was excellent.</p>
                <p>With regard to my publication (and the whole special issue), I think it can be of interest for the academia and industry, as it describes a new method that can be used in behavioral neuropharmacology and drug screening. Therefore, the reviews reported in the special issue may attract interest from the researchers working in the drug discovery and drug evaluation fields.</p>

                <p>It was a fulfilling experience working with Bentham Science Publication “Infectious Disorders – Drug Targets,” Right from the submission to the proof reading of the article, all of the employees of Bentham Science Publication “<bold>Infectious Disorders – Drug Targets,</bold>” are genuinely kind, concerned, competent and hearing to the issues raised by the authors. </p>
                <p>I would like to say that I am very much interested to work with Bentham Science Publication in future. I am also interested to write scientific review articles and short communications on dental subjects, and a few related medical subjects.

                <p>It has been a pleasure working with you as always. Publishing for the third time for Recent Patents on Anti-Infective Drug Discovery, I have to say that I am completely satisfied regarding the services of the journal's staff. If you expect me to find some kind of limitation so that you can improve it, I'm afraid I will disappoint you.. Everything was as it should. I was especially satisfied by the speed of the answers to all of my queries and by the close collaboration throughout the whole process.</p>

                <p>Our relationship with the editorial staff and EiC was very lucid and satisfactory. The peer review process was fast initially and moderate further. It also might be because we specially faced a problem regarding the late review response in a case. Anyway, we queried to the editorial team and received quick response, that the required last reviewer comments were not received yet then. The reviewers’ suggestions were very helpful. We are deeply indebted to all the respected anonymous reviewers. The overall quality and authority of the journal was very satisfying. We will surely recommend the journal to our colleagues as a source of high quality papers</p>

                <p>It was a pleasure to work with the editorial staff of Current Biotechnology. In brief, the peer review process was smooth within a reasonable period of time, and the suggestions of the reviewers really helped improve the presentation and quality of the manuscript. The journal is relatively new and I like the style.  I will recommend the journal to my colleagues, and hope there will be a further increasing number of publications.</p>

                <p>Very good communication and rapid reply and assistance was received. The peer review process was quite fast and efficient.  Also, the review process was very rigid which is of great comfort to authors and will help establish and increase the journal impact factor. The journal has a lot of potential for growth and I hope it will become one of the key journals in the field in the next 3-5 years.</p>

                <p>We would like to express our gratitude to Bentham Science Publishers for the wonderful experience while working with the journal on this mini-thematic issue. There are several reasons for this enthusiasm.  </p>
                <p>We are grateful to the Editor-in-Chief, Dr Francis J. Castellino, for contacting us and offering us the chance to publish in Current Drug Targets, and accepting our proposal for a mini-thematic issue. 
It was a wonderful experience working with Shabana Seemee at the time of submission and processing of the papers. Shabana was always ready to support us whenever we had either a problem or a query. 
</p>
                <p>We would like to acknowledge the high standard of all others who took care of editing and processing the papers to obtain the best final quality at the time of publication.</p>
                <p>We would be delighted to continue to collaborate with the journal.</p>

                <p>First, I am very thankful to Bentham Science Publishers for their support in publishing two of my manuscripts in "CNSA-MC" and two in "Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering". Bentham Science also helped me to introduce and share them further with other scientists. Ultimately results the publications in a way to accurately deposit your work, as well as plan your future direction of experiments. </p>

                <p>I wish to give a few words of appreciation related to the sincere and kind service provided by the Editorial Team of Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology, BSP at this moment of getting published three scientific research papers of our Institution. </p>
                <p>Since the start, the communication has been prompt, clear and cordial. I could sense the excellent team effort. I could read between the lines the commitment of the editors especially Ms. Kashmala Khan.I eagerly wait for the immediate next chance of working with you again. Thank you for inviting me to express my experience and opinion.</p>

                <p>The peer review process was fast and although we had some discussions with one of the reviewers’, we found their objections constructive, which helped us to improve our text, making it more accessible to the scientific community.  We had a very good communication with the editorial staff and guest editors. They were professional and accessible, and assisted us a lot through all the publication process. In general, we had a very good experience working with Current Biotechnology.</p>

                <p>It has been a pleasure to work with Bentham Science Publishers, which has facilitated publication of my research work which I strongly believe, has got translational potential and creates therapeutic opportunities to patients suffering from ischaemic pancreatitis.</p>
                <p>The submission and publication process were clear and structured. The email communication was always courteous, clear and efficient.</p>
                <p>The journal Current Pharmaceutical Design has got a high impact factor and is indexed in PubMed elevating its credibility.  I am very proud to have co-operated with your team and hope to continue in future.</p>

                <p>I served as a guest editor for special issue of Current Drug Delivery in 2014. Organization of the issue was done smoothly as I was provided with outstanding assistance from CDD editorial team. It was my pleasure to work closely with CDD team, and if opportunity arises in the future, I would be happy to avail it. </p>

                <p>My publication could be of interest for many pharmaceutical companies which are working with Parkinsonian patients which are now with multi-morbidity. </p>

                <p>My experience of working with Bentham Science Publishers, I express my satisfaction both as author and as a reader of your journals</p>
                <p>My submission: "Intracellular (polymorphonuclear) magnesium content in patients bronchial asthma attacks With JR Soc Med Between 1995 Aug; 88 (8): 441-5" is likely to be of interest to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology or the biomedical industry. Based on this study we wanted to propose the industry a procedure that could radically change the treatment of bronchial asthma and other lung pathologies.</p>

                <p>I am glad to have my work published in Anti- Cancer Agents in Cancer. I found the publication process to be professional and efficient. The papers are reviewed rapidly and included promptly to Pubmed.</p>
                <p>I highly recommend scientists to submit their papers at Bentham Science Publishers. </p>

                <p>My experience of working with Bentham Science Publishers has been a wonderful journey of author-friendly handling of my manuscripts right from the submission to the print stage. I am grateful to Bentham Science for the same.</p>
                <p>Given the promptness to address the author queries and quality of services such as a short span of time from the submission to the final print of the article, I would like to continue contributing my research to Bentham Science journals in future as well.</p>

                <p>&#x201C;I really appreciate working with Bentham Science Publishers. It was a pleasure to collaborate with Ms. Shabana Seemee and Ms. Samina Khan, as they expressed a high level of professionalism. Moreover, their advices and suggestions concerning revision of the manuscript were clear and allowed fruitful assistance.</p>
                <p>Our submission is likely to be of interest to the pharmaceutical and biomedical industry.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, I have also forwarded free trial access to Bentham Science Journals’ offer to our librarians.</p>
                <p>Thank you very much for cooperation.&#x201D;</p>

                <p>I am every much glad to edit a special issue entitled ‘New Development in Wastewater Treatment Technology’ in &#x201C;Current Environmental Engineering&#x201D;. This has been a particularly productive experience since I now have the opportunity to communicate colleagues in the water technology area. Bentham Science Publishers is very professional and is providing a wonderful service to both readers and authors. I wish Bentham Science Publishers every success&#x0021;.</p>

                <p>I am completely satisfied with the service I received from Bentham Science Publishers, right from the submission of our research paper in ‘Current Green Chemistry’ to its publication in the journal.

                <p>"Publishing with Bentham in my experience has always been a great pleasure; I never had problems or unnecessary delays, and regarding the points raised by the Referee's .Even if they required a lot of changes, it always led to an improvement in the manuscript quality; thus, a special thanks for the referee's work and quality.</p>
                <p>I would also like to appreciate the Editor of the journal, as he was able to select competent people for this crucial task.</p>
                <p>Additionally, it is always a pleasure to read articles published in Current Medicinal Chemistry; owing to their quality and the up-to-date topics. <bold>Current Medicinal Chemistry</bold> is one of the few journals that I check every month. In particular, my last submission is of interest for both pharmaceutical and biomedical industry.”</p>

                <p>Our article was published in the special issue, &#x201C;Chemistry and Biology of Antioxidants&#x201D; of Current Medicinal Chemistry at Bentham Science Publishers. Our experiences with the Manager Graphics Ms. Naila Rafique and Senior Manager Publications Ms. Beenish Anwer were very positive. Both of them were not only professional, effective and helpful but also quite pleasant to work with.</p>

                <p>In the last three years I published three reviews about neural networks and the resulting pharmacotherapy in diseases such as generalized epilepsy, major depression in two Bentham Science Publishers’ journals: <bold>Current Medicinal Chemistry and Current Drug Therapy</bold>. The reviews reached a large diffusion and were quoted several times in other scientific works. Through this activity, I was also able to assist for the second time actively at the International Conference on Drug Discovery and Therapy in Dubai.</p>
                <p>I am very satisfied with the cooperation from Bentham Service Publishers, and I would like to mention the excellent communication and the technical assistance in the publication of my article. I will go on working to examine neural networks in neurological and psychiatric diseases in order to optimize a multimodal pharmacotherapy.</p>

                <p>My experience working with Bentham Science Publishers was excellent and among the best I've had with publishing anywhere.</p>
                <p>I worked with Ms. Samina Khan at Bentham. She was prompt to respond and her responses were always helpful. We have had a number of correspondences and she always worked things through to completion</p>

                <p>I found the handling and reviewing of our manuscripts problem-free; feedback from the referees was both rapid and constructive. Galley proofs were received only a short time after acceptance. I have already received a number of enquiries from the scientific community for a copy. I would definitely recommend CNS &#x0026; Neurological Disorders - Drug Targets to authors for their future publications.</p>

                <p>My first contact with Bentham Science Publishers started after being invited to contribute to the journal “Current Organic Chemistry”. I have to say that my experience has been very positive during the reviewing and editing processes. I hope to have another opportunity to publish our research in Bentham Science journals. Thank you for your excellent work.</p>

                <p>I worked with Bentham Science Publishers, for the first time by the invitation of the chief editor. I was very happy to work with the journal <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="journal/index.php?journalID=coc">Current Organic Chemistry</uri>. The quality of your services is very high and I did not have any problems for publishing my manuscript.</p>

                <p>I am very much pleased with Bentham Science Publishers publishing procedure. The fact that 5 reviewers evaluated our paper is very important. It certainly helps “Current Organic Chemistry” to keep up its high standards, but at the same time and more importantly for authors, it assists them in refining manuscripts in the best possible way.</p>
                <p>The administrative personnel are very helpful and efficient.</p>

                <p>My experience with Bentham Science Publishers is based on publishing in Current Organic Chemistry. The editing process was based on a quick, correct and fruitful communication, including peer-reviewing.</p>
                <p>I recommend the publication in Bentham's journals to other authors as well.</p>

                <p>My experience with Bentham Science Publishers is a few years old, and it isgetting better and better with time!In my opinion, Bentham Science Publishers is about to reach the maturity level in the publishing industry. I like the attempts to create new electronic submission system. Furthermore,  Ilike  the huge array of titles and the possibilities to publish in the concept of open access.</p>
                <p>My interaction with the Editors has always been very well and I appreciate the understanding of the real and everyday scientific work handled by them. </p>
                <p>Thanks to Bentham Science Publishers, the promotion of scientific achievements has reached a level globally.</p>

                <p>&#x201C;Recently, I had a nice experience through the publication of a paper in the <bold>Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology</bold>. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the Editor in-chief of the Current pharmaceutical Biotechnology, and especially Publication Manager Ms. Sumaiya Azhar for her outstanding professionalism, kindness and availability in the management of the peer review process and the editing the manuscript. I really appreciate this nice moment&#x201D;.</p>

                <p>Our contribution was a review article entitled “Lipid Metabolism During Pregnancy and its Implications for Fetal Growth”, having Herrera, E. and Ortega-Senovilla, H. as authors.</p>
                <p>We were invited by Dr. ZanetaKimber-Trojnar to contribute with a review article about some selected aspects of lipid metabolism/disturbances in pregnancy patients. After accepting to write our article I may say that our relationship with Dr. Kimber-Trojnar was very fluid and easy.</p>
                <p>We also have had a nice and easy relation with the Sr. Manager Publications of Bentham Science Publishers, with regards to handling the proofs.</p>
                <p>Thank you very much for your attention.</p>

                <p>Thank you very much for asking me to give a feedback about the <bold>“Letters in Drug Design &#x0026; Discovery”</bold>. I always feel very comfortable whenever I submit any article to publish in this journal.</p>
                <p>The review process is fast and sound. I always receive prompt replies from Ms. Aiman Islam and Ambreen Irshad. Both are very sincere and helpful. So far, four of my articles have been published in this journal and hopefully this number will be increased in the coming years. Moreover, I encouraged many of my colleagues to submit their paper in this journal.</p>
                <p>Finally, “Letters in Drug Design &#x0026; Discovery” is a very good journal and I hope to have better relationship in future.”</p>

                <p>I would like to express my sincere thanks for all you efforts providing the scientific community with diverse journal topics. Apart from the current article, which is going to be published in <bold>Letters in Drug Design &#x0026; Discovery</bold>, we have recently another article published in Current Bioinformatics. We have had a great experience working with Bentham Science Publishers.</p>

                <p>The review process of my article, accepted in the journal <bold>“Letters in Drug Design &#x0026; Discovery”</bold>, went smoothly with prompt action. In my opinion, the journal LDDD should emerge as a leading journal in the area of drug design and discovery, as to my knowledge there are only a few journals that focus solely on this area. Nevertheless, I am a regular contributor to this journal and would like to continue to submit my future research work to LDDD.</p>

                <p>As I am from a country where English in not native, the language of my article needed editing and the people at Bentham Science Publishers helped me through every step of the way. As for my opinion, the Bentham Science Publishers can offer excellent service for English-editing.</p>

                <p>It was a great experience working with Bentham Science Publishers. I would like to express my appreciation for the prompt and early responses received by Bentham during the different stages of our paper’s acceptance and publication.</p>
                <p>I am glad that I received timely, regular replies to all my queries. It is a good proof of how responsible and serious the editorial team at Bentham is towards their customer’s time and I wish them a lot of success.</p>

                <p>I have been publishing my research work in many different journals since five years, but publishing my article in Letters in Organic Chemistry was both unique and rewarding. It was my first experience working with Bentham Science Publishers, and I found the editorial team to be competent and cooperative. Even when I suggested changes in my manuscript at the last moment, they were glad to oblige and incorporate them. My paper was accepted and revised in a swift manner, and I would approve the publication process at Bentham to be professional, rapid and hassle-free. </p>

                <p>It was a great experience working with Bentham Science Publishers. The reviews were fair, prompt and the suggestions given made us analyze our work more deeply and unearth important issues and their solutions.</p>
                <p>The proof-reading process of Bentham Science was also prompt and author-friendly. They took utmost care to ensure that all of our concerns were addressed in the final published form of the paper. The discounts offered to authors were also most appreciated.</p>
                <p>The fast communication and periodical updates made us submit another research paper to Bentham Science Publishers in their journal, Current Bioinformatics, which is currently under review</p>
                <p>Thank you Bentham Science Publishers&#x0021;</p>

                <p>I  am  satisfied  and  surprised  with  the  intensive  and  academic  peer -review  process.   Comments of most reviewers are relevant and clear.  Editor’s responses are rapid.  I  feel  proud  to  publish  my  paper  in Bentham Science Publishers’ highly  commendable  journal “Recent  Patents  on  Anti-Cancer  Drug  Discovery.</p>
                <p>I  wish for the  journal to continually  be cited  in  the  world’s standard  database, such  as  PubMed, MEDLINE, Index  Medicus, SCOPUS, EMBASE, etc.  And expect the journal to maintain the high Impact Factor.</p>

                <p>I can only find the very best words for everyone at Bentham Science Publishers whom I have worked with, starting with the editor-in-chief of Recent Patents on Biomarkers, Dr. Zaman, the publications manager, Raheela Anjum, and also all other people involved in the publishing process. Everyone is working with the utmost professionalism, knowledge and skill.</p>
                <p>I can only commend the quality and precision with which the work is being done by the Recent Patents on Biomarkers team.</p>

                <p>My experience of publishing in Bentham Science Publishers’ journal &#x201C;Recent Patent in Drug Delivery and Formulation&#x201D; has been quite productive and memorable. </p>
                <p>I received excellent support and assistance during each and every stage of the publishing process, starting from the article submission to the final acceptance of my paper. </p>

                <p>I would like to thank Bentham Science Publishers for their coordination and immediate responses. I have had many publications in Elsevier journals as well as other international journals, but I found “Drug Delivery and Formulation”  from BSP to be better than any of them. </p>
                <p>The guidance and support from their team helped me a lot to finish my research paper&#x0021; </p>

                <p>As being a Diabetes research scientist and researcher, it was a great pleasure working with one of the Bentham Science Publications, “Recent Patents on Endocrine, Metabolic &#x0026; Immune Drug Discovery 2013.</p>
                <p>The “quick” response from the journal publication team at every step was one of the unique characteristics as compared to other international journals.</p>
                <p>Right from the submission till the actual publication of my manuscript, I felt that the journal’s staff is very responsible and serious towards the researchers and their work, keeping me informed and involved at every step. Apart from the quick response, the overall guidance provided by the journal’s publication team was commendable. There were no unnecessary details, and the cordial environment makes the researchers more comfortable throughout the process of publication.</p>
                <p>After the publication, offers/trial send by the staff to the authors encourage them towards further research and publication submissions. I had never been offered these unique post-publication services by any other publishers before. This ensures that the Bentham Science team will remain in contact with the authors and researches even after the publication process is over.</p>
                <p>I will recommend the journals to my colleagues to consider for publishing their own work. In future as well, I will consider the journal “Recent Patents on Endocrine, Metabolic &#x0026; Immune Drug Discovery” for submitting my original research.</p>
