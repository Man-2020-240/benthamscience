The text may be subdivided further according to the areas to be discussed, which should be followed by the List of Abbreviations, Conflict of Interest, Acknowledgements and Reference sections. For review, the manuscript should be divided into title page, abstract and the main text. The text may be subdivided further according to the areas to be discussed, which should be followed by the Acknowledgements and Reference sections. For Research Articles the manuscript should begin with the title page and abstract followed by the main text, which must be structured into separate sections as <bold>Introduction, Material and Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, Trial Registration, Conflict of Interest, Acknowledgements and References</bold>. The Review Article should mention any previous important recent and old reviews in the field and contain a comprehensive discussion starting with the general background of the field. It should then go on to discuss the salient features of recent developments. The authors should avoid presenting material which has already been published in a previous review. The authors are advised to present and discuss their observations in brief. The manuscript style must be uniform throughout the text and 10 pt Times New Roman fonts should be used. The full term for an abbreviation should precede its first appearance in the text unless it is a standard unit of measurement. The reference numbers should be given in square brackets in the text. Italics should be used for Binomial names of organisms (Genus and Species), for emphasis and for unfamiliar words or phrases. Non-assimilated words from Latin or other languages should also be italicized <italic>e.g. per se, et al. etc</italic>.</p>

            <p>Important points to remember while submitting clinical trials:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Each manuscript should clearly state an objective or hypothesis; the design and methods (including the study setting and dates, patients or participants with inclusion and exclusion criteria, or data sources, and how these were selected for the study); the essential features of any interventions; the main outcome measures; the main results of the study; a comment section placing the results in context with the published literature and addressing study limitations; and the conclusions. Data included in research reports must be original. </p>
</list-item>

<list-item>
<p>Trial registry name, registration identification number, and the URL for the registry should be included at the end of the abstract and also in the space provided on the online manuscript submission form. If your research article reports the results of a controlled health care intervention, list the trial registry, along with the unique identifying number (Please note that there should be no space between the letters and numbers of your trial registration number). Studies designed for other purposes, such as to study pharmacokinetics or major toxicity (e.g., phase 1 trials), are exempted. </p>
</list-item>

<list-item>
<p>	All reports of randomized trials should include a section entitled “Randomization and Masking”, within the Methods section.</p>
</list-item>

<list-item>
<p>The manuscript must include a statement identifying the institutional and/or licensing committee that has approved the experiments, including any relevant details. </p>
</list-item>

<list-item>
<p>	The SI system of units and the recommended international non-proprietary name (rINN) for drug names must be used. Kindly ensure that the dose, route, and frequency of administration of any drug you mention are correct. </p>
</list-item>

<list-item>
<p>Please ensure that the clinical trials sponsored by pharmaceutical companies follow the guidelines on good publication practice: (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.gpp-guidelines.org">www.gpp-guidelines.org</uri>)</p>

If the figures are found to be sub-standard, then the manuscripts will be rejected and the authors offered the option of figure improvement professionally by <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://eureka-science.com/publishing.php">Eureka Science</uri> The costs for such improvement will be charged to the authors.</p>
            <p>Illustrations should be embedded in the text file, and must be numbered consecutively in the order of their appearance. Each figure should include only a single illustration which should be cropped to minimize the amount of space occupied by the illustration.</p>
            <p>If a figure is in separate parts, all parts of the figure must be provided in a single composite illustration file.</p>

                <p>Halftone image type is a continuous tone photograph  containing no text. It should have the preferred file format  TIFF, with color mode being RGB or Grayscale, in a resolution of 300 dpi.</p>
                <p>Combination image type is an image containing halftone  , text or line art elements. It should have the preferred file format  TIFF, with color mode being RGB or Grayscale, in a resolution of 500-900 dpi</p>

                <p>Bentham Science does not process figures submitted in GIF format.</p>
                <p>For TIFF or EPS figures with considerably large file size restricting the file size in online submissions is advisable. Authors may therefore convert to JPEG format before submission as this results in significantly reduced file size and upload time, while retaining acceptable quality. JPEG is a ‘lossy’ format. However, in order to maintain acceptable image quality, it is recommended that JPEG files are saved at High or Maximum quality.</p>
                <p>Zipit or Stuffit tools should not be used to compress files prior to submission as the resulting compression through these tools is always negligible.</p>

                <title>Image Conversion Tools:</title>
                <p>There are many software packages, many of them freeware or shareware, capable of converting to and from different graphics formats, including PNG.</p>
                <p>General tools for image conversion include Graphic Converter on the Macintosh, Paint Shop Pro, for Windows, and ImageMagick, available on Macintosh, Windows and UNIX platforms.</p>
                <p>Bitmap images (e.g. screenshots) should not be converted to EPS as they result in a much larger file size than the equivalent JPEG, TIFF, PNG or BMP, and poor quality. EPS should only be used for images produced by vector-drawing applications such as Adobe Illustrator or CorelDraw. Most vector-drawing applications can be saved in, or exported as, EPS format. If the images were originally prepared in an Office application, such as Word or PowerPoint, original Office files should be directly uploaded to the site, instead of being converted to JPEG or another format of low quality.</p>

            <title>PLAGIARISM PREVENTION:</title>
            <p>Bentham Science Publishers uses the iThenticate software to detect instances of overlapping and similar text in submitted manuscripts. iThenticate software checks content against a database of periodicals, the Internet, and a comprehensive article database. It generates a similarity report, highlighting the percentage overlap between the uploaded article and the published material. Any instance of content overlap is further scrutinized for suspected plagiarism according to the publisher’s Editorial Policies. Bentham Science allows an overall similarity of 20% for a manuscript to be considered for publication. The similarity percentage is further checked keeping the following important points in view:</p>
            <sec>
                <title>Low Text Similarity:</title>
                <p>The text of every submitted manuscript is checked using the Content Tracking mode in iThenticate. The Content Tracking mode ensures that manuscripts with an overall low percentage similarity (but which may have a higher similarity from a single source) are not overlooked. The acceptable limit for similarity of text from a <underline>single source</underline> is 5%. If the similarity level is above 5%, the manuscript is returned to the author for paraphrasing the text and citing the original source of the copied material.</p>
                <p>It is important to mention that the text taken from different sources with an overall low similarity percentage will be considered as a <underline>plagiarized content</underline> if the majority of the article is a combination of copied material.  </p>

                <title>High Text Similarity:</title>
                <p>There may be some manuscripts with an overall low similarity percentage, but a higher percentage from a single source. A manuscript may have less than 20% overall similarity but there may be 15 % similar text taken from a single article. The similarity index in such cases is higher than the approved limit for a single source. Authors are advised to thoroughly rephrase the similar text and properly cite the original source to avoid plagiarism and copyright violation. </p>

                <title>Types of Plagiarism:</title>
                <p>We all know that scholarly manuscripts are written after thorough review of previously published articles. It is therefore not easy to draw a clear boundary between legitimate representation and plagiarism. However, the following important features can assist in identifying different kinds of plagiarized content. These are:
                <list list-type="bullet">
                    <list-item>
                        <p>Reproduction of others words, sentences, ideas or findings as one’s own without proper acknowledgement.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>Text recycling, also known as self-plagiarism. It is an author’s use of a previous publication in another paper without proper citation and acknowledgement of the original source.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>Paraphrasing poorly: Copying complete paragraphs and modifying a few words without changing the structure of original sentences or changing the sentence structure but not the words.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>Verbatim copying of text without putting quotation marks and not acknowledging the work of the original author.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>Properly citing a work but poorly paraphrasing the original text is considered as unintentional plagiarism. Similarly, manuscripts with language somewhere between paraphrasing and quoting are not acceptable. Authors  should either paraphrase properly or quote and in both cases, cite the original source.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>Higher similarity in the abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and discussion and conclusion sections indicates that the manuscript may contain plagiarized text. Authors can easily explain these parts of the manuscript in many ways. However, technical terms and sometimes standard procedures cannot be rephrased; therefore Editors must review these sections carefully before making a decision.</p>

                <title>Plagiarism in Published Manuscripts:</title>
                <p>Published manuscripts which are found to contain plagiarized text are retracted from the journal website after careful investigation and approval by the Editor-in-Chief of the journal. A ‘Retraction Note’ as well as a link to the original article is published on the electronic version of the plagiarized manuscript and an addendum with retraction notification in the journal concerned. </p>
