                    <p>Frontiers in Clinical Drug Research - Anti-Allergy Agents is an exciting eBook series comprising a selection of updated review articles relevant to the recent development of pharmacological agents used for the treatment of allergies. The scope of the reviews includes clinical trials of anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic drugs, drug delivery strategies used to treat specific allergies (such as inflammation, asthma and dermatological allergies), lifestyle dependent modes of therapies and the immunological or metabolic mechanisms that are of interest to researchers as targets for new drugs. The first volume of this series sheds light on new therapies that can be employed for allergic reactions in patients (both traditional and non-traditional therapies), nutrition based therapies and the use of substances such as omalizumab and adrenaline to counter inflammatory response and anaphylaxis in patients.</p>

                    <p>Prof. Lahiri (Professor of Neurobiology, Indiana University School  )  Editor-in-Chief of the Bentham Science journal "Current Alzheimer Research" (IF: 3.289) recently gave an interview to the Press team of Indiana University School of Medicine regarding his team’s research on the role of miRNAs against Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
                    <p>He described in detail the work done in his lab on the role of microRNAs (non-coding RNA molecules that regulate protein production) in Alzheimer’s disease. In the interview, Lahiri described the functions of microRNAs, and the importance of their findings to the research community involved in developing new strategies to treat the disease.</p>
                    <p>“Alzheimer’s disease occurs when there is a buildup of amyloid-beta peptide in plaque (APP) in the brain,” explained Lahiri. “Why these plaques form remains a mystery, but finding ways to regulate and disrupt these plaques is where our research begins.” One of the normal functions of APP is removing excess iron from cells, which is believed to limit the formation of plaques. Lahiri’s team discovered activity in miR-346, a unique microRNA molecule which is involved in up-regulating the production and subsequent buildup of APP in conjunction with iron responsive elements. These findings suggest that a healthy amount of iron, APP and RNA complexes (a combination called FeAR) must exist to maintain APP homeostasis, which in turn is necessary for keeping the brain healthy. With further research, the team hopes to learn more about miR-346 signaling and how the findings can be applied to future patients in the clinic.</p>

                    <p>Viewing the present situation in chemistry research, Bentham Science Publishers continues to explore new ideas and concepts. This has been demonstrated by launching several new journals and also expanding the scope of the existing journals. We have been publishing <italic>Current Organocatalysis</italic> for the past three years. However, we were unable to accept a number of manuscripts since those were not related to organocatalysis, but they were related to synthetic methods. Therefore, we have decided to expand the scope and aim of <italic>Current Organocatalysis</italic> and give it a new name, <italic>Current Organocatalysis and Synthetic Methods</italic> starting from January, 2018.</p>
                    <p>
                        <italic>Current Organocatalysis and Synthetic Methods</italic> is an international peer-reviewed journal that publishes significant research in all areas of organocatalysis. The journal covers organo homogeneous/heterogeneous catalysis, innovative mechanistic studies and kinetics of organocatalytic processes, focusing on practical, theoretical and computational aspects. It also includes potential applications of organocatalysts in the fields of drug discovery, synthesis of novel molecules, synthetic method development, green chemistry and chemoenzymatic reactions.</p>
                    <p>This journal also covers new methods, reagents, mechanisms of chemical synthesis. New synthetic methods have become extremely popular for the preparation of simple to structurally complex molecules. For example, in many instances it is necessary to demonstrate the usefulness of the new methods. An effective method produces products with high yield in an economical way. There is an existing challenge to identify appropriate synthetic methods that are diastereoselective, enantioselective, and chemoselective. Synthesis of molecules that have commercial interest due to their medicinal importance and the extraction of natural products by new methods requires careful thinking, design and execution. Development of efficient reagents and conditions are necessary for the retrosynthetic analysis that is dependent on a small part of the desired molecules. <italic>Current Organocatalysis and Synthetic Methods</italic> accepts papers, reviews, short communications, and perspectives. It is the premier source information related to the fields of of organocatalysis and synthetic methods n for chemists, biologists and engineers pursuing research in industry and academia.</p>

                    <p>September 6, 2016: The recent issue of Current Medicinal Chemistry (CMC, Vol. 23; Iss. 24) features a tribute to the Nobel Prize winning chemist, Professor Ferid Murad (George Washington University). Prof. Murad has been recognized in the field of medicinal chemistry for his contributions to our understanding of nitric oxide release in the body through the action of nitroglycerin and related drugs. Prof. Murad’s work pointed out that release of nitric oxide leads to a biochemical cascade that results in high cGMP, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation. He, along with Furchgott and Ignarro, were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology &#x0026; Medicine in 1998 for these discoveries.
</p>
                    <p> This issue brings forth 16 reviews written by eminent experts on the biochemistry of nitric oxide from diverse scholarly angles. Readers will find updated research on topics ranging from  cGMP pathways triggered by nitric oxide, the effect of nitric oxide on specific cells to the value of nitric oxide in certain disease states. The editors of CMC thank the contributors to this outstanding collection of excellent reviews  and hope that that readers can benefit from the advances in medicinal chemistry triggered by Prof. Murad’s monumental  research contributions.

                        <italic>A new review explores the mechanisms activating cell death and blocking proliferation of mutated cells, with a view towards creating more effective therapies combining both programs.</italic>
                    </p>
                    <p>A common feature of cancer and aging is cells’ reduced ability to respond to stress-induced damage to DNA or cellular structures. Specifically, changes occur in the protective processes of apoptosis and cellular senescence, whose roles in cancer and aging are thoroughly reviewed by Cerella <italic>et al</italic>. in <italic>Current Drug Targets</italic>. The authors outline the evidence that these processes are regulated by separate but intertwined pathways. Understanding the precise mechanisms, they conclude, could lead to combination therapies for cancer and aging able to harness the benefits of both apoptosis and senescence, while limiting the drawbacks of either.
</p>
                    <p>
The review highlights anti-apoptotic mechanisms relevant for cancer therapy (e.g. inhibition of Bcl-2 family members blocking cell death, or of COX-2, whose aberrant expression is correlated with chronic inflammation and the most aggressive forms of colorectal cancer). The authors also discussthe dual nature of apoptosis in aging, contrastingitsprotective removal of cells “damaged” by telomere attrition — a hallmark of aging — versus the lifespan reduction recently observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> exhibiting hyperactive apoptosis.	
</p>
                    <p>
Similarly, while cellular senescence is shown to be an alternative to apoptosis, blocking damaged cells from proliferating, it is also capable of promoting tumorigenesis and aging. The also review outlines the current knowledge on cellular avoidance of senescence, as well as clues to its reversibility. 
</p>
                    <p>
Cerella <italic>et al</italic>. find no consensus on the complex interactions between programs for apoptosis and senescence: one may back up the other, or they may play equally essential, complementary roles. Importantly, the authors note that certain cancer treatments triggering apoptosisactually activate senescence, too. The latter’s sensitivity to epigenetic mechanisms could provide avenues for reactivating senescence in cancer cells, thus improving current therapies. However, for combined treatments,researchers need to uncouple the beneficial effects (anti-cancer, anti-aging) from the undesirable, promoting tumor growth and aging.

                    <p>A group of researchers from Japan has examined how the hold position of a red blood cell affects its mechanical characteristics in tensile tests. 

</p>
                    <p>The tensile test is the most fundamental type of mechanical test in material science to understand mechanical properties of material of interest. Although the tensile test has also been used in cellular mechanics, large variations were found in experimental data unlike metallic materials. Conventionally, the variations were attributed to sample-to-sample variations as is common in biological studies. Yet the researchers, who have been engaged in tensile tests of cells for many years, experienced difficulties in controlling the hold position of cells under a microscope using a needle and a micropipette, and hypothesized that differences in the hold position yielded the experimental errors.

</p>
                    <p>The researchers reproduced the tensile test of a red blood cell in silico using a particle method that describes the motion of fluid and the structure as the collective behavior of particles. This method allows a fluid-structure interaction analysis with ease compared to other numerical methods such as finite element methods. 

</p>
                    <p>The results show significant varitions in the deformed geometry of the red blood cell during the tensile test, as well as variations in strain distribution. Of the hold patterns examined, with an applied strain of 0.8, the misaligned stretch increased the maximum of the first principal strain by 65–85% in comparison to the aligned stretch. 

</p>
                    <p>Although it would be ideal to precisely align the hold position with the stretch to gain correct data, this represents a significant practical challenge. A take-home message of this study is that, for the interpretationof RBC tensile test results, we should always bear in mind that tensile test data are significantly affected by the hold position.

                    <p>The objective of our study was to exploit the principles of quality by design (QbD) to assist the formulation development. QbD helped identify the variables causing potential risk to the quality attributes namely, particle size and entrapment efficiency. The factors causing high risk to the quality attributes were further studied using an experimental design in order to improve the product quality. The application of QbD aided the development of stable formulations of enhanced quality. The optimized PEGylated mixed micelles of meloxicam (M-PMM) had a high percent entrapment efficiency of 73.6% ± 0.72% and mean particle size of 132 nm ± 67nm. The cytotoxicity of M-PMM was much higher (GI 50 &#x003C;10µg/mL) than free meloxicam (MLX) and conventional mixed micelles (GI 50 >80µg/mL). This was achieved essentially due to the presence of PEG corona which enhanced the cellular association with the HT-29 cell lines. The PEG corona also enhanced the stability of the mixed micelles formulation as observed in the zeta potential data. The M-PMM had a zeta potential of -31mv. It was observed that M-PMM was capable of releasing MLX in a slow and sustained manner; releasing 62.7% ± 0.37% drug in 24h. The formation of ellipsoidal mixed micelles was confirmed by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) analysis. The shape and size of the M-PMM was further corroborated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) results justified that MLX was entrapped inside the PEGylated mixed micelles and was stabilized in the amorphous form. A long term stability study indicated that the formulation was stable for three months. As a result, it was concluded that PEGylated mixed micelles can be considered to be a promising system for the delivery of MLX. Furthermore, the in vitro cytotoxicity results affirmed that M-PMM could serve as a better alternative for treating and preventing human colorectal cancer.</p>

                    <p>Water quality surveillance is given maximum priority, for safety assessment of the environment and human health in particular. Among the inorganic contaminants of water, heavy metals are getting much attention because of their non-biodegradable nature and permanent accumulation in living tissues causing lethal biological disorders. Consequently, there is a growing urgency for the development of simple, quick, versatile, and reliable methods for control recognition of metal ions at very low concentrations. In this context, <italic>N</italic>-[[(6-Amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1,3-dimethyl-2,4-dioxo-5-pyrimidinyl)amino]thioxomethyl]- benzamide, a novel diaminouracilbenzoylthiourea (DAUTU)-based fluorescent probe was synthesized in high yield via a single-step facile reaction, and characterized by various spectral techniques. The chemically stable probe exhibited strong fluorescent emission at 385 nm upon excitation at 362 nm. The probe has been successfully deployed for the selective detection and accurate determination of trace amountsof Ag<sup>+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions in aqueous samples spiked with competing metal ions, as well as in natural water samples thus demonstrating its versatile applicability. The detection was pH-independent, and detection limits ranged from 0.0716-0.286 &#956;M for the analyzed cations which is sufficiently well below the safety levels set by U.S. EPA. Importantly, detection was achieved in short response times with high accuracy, reproducibility, sensitivity, and reversibility.</p>
                    <p>The sensing principle is based on remarkable fluorescence quenching in presence of the detected metal ions via excitation energy transfer from the probe to the d-orbital in the atoms of the metals. In summary, we developed an efficient, cost effective, and easily operated uracil-based chemosensor for the rapid detection and sensitive determination of Ag<sup>+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion concentrations in diverse real world applications.</p>

                    <p>Thereview article deals with Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) associated with Atypical Antipsychotics (AAP). RLS, although a common disorder, is frequently of unclear origin. It is often associated with significant distress and when related to medications, can interfere with the compliance. It reduces the psychosocial quality of life, which is comparable to that of patients having type-2 diabetes mellitus, and osteoarthritis.</p>
                    <p>In this research, Dr. Shilpa and her colleagues review the evidence for AAP causing RLS. There is limited information available in this area comprising only a few case reports and case series. It is possible that such movements are not being recognised or sought for by the clinicians, as it is not a widely known or reported side effect. After elaborating on and discussing the available case reports and case series, the paper goes on to discuss the implicated pathophysiological mechanisms of RLS associated with AAP. A discussion about the central dopaminergic dysfunction, neuroimaging findings, genetic influences, and brain iron deficiency is included in the paper.</p>
                    <p>The researchers have shed light on the clinical implications of RLS associated with AAP andalso the measures to address it. Greater awareness of the potential causes of RLS, and its differentiation from akathisia and illness related agitation might help in reducing the distress associated with it and improve compliance in patients using atypical antipsychotic agents. </p>

                    <p>The introduction of targeted therapies has revolutionized the management of cancer patients. Agents that target the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), called anti-VEGF, have been administrated for the treatment of various cancer types, inhibiting the carcinogenetic procedure of angiogenesis. 
</p>
                    <p>Though their beneficial impact on cancer patients’ outcome, anti-VEGF drugs are accompanied with a broad spectrum of side effects. After searching the literature, we focused on the association between mainly used anti-VEGF anticancer drugs and hypertension (HTN). 
</p>
                    <p>Many factors are involved in the emergence of HTN in these patients such as reduced levels of nitric oxide (NO) and/or microvascular rarefaction. The incidence of HTN is high and dependent on which agent is used for treating cancer patients.</p>
                    <p>In two large meta-analyses, bevacizumab-treated patients had an incidence of developing HTN up to 24% while patients with renal cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors treated with sunitinib had a HTN incidence of approximately 22%. Antihypertensive therapies (i.e angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, b-blockers or diuretics) have been used for the management of anti-VEGF-induced HTN. </p>
                    <p>Interestingly, the onset of HTN can be considered as a possible biomarker of clinical response to VEGF inhibition (VEGFi) treatment, seeming to be correlated with better overall survival (OS) and prolonged  progression free survival  in these patients.</p>
                    <p>Close monitoring of blood pressure (BP) levels, early BP control, proper therapeutic interventions are crucial points in the management of HTN caused by VEGFi. In severe hypertensive cases, discontinuation of anti-VEGF agents or switching to another treatment option might be required. Further research is needed for this exact entity to be elucidated and proper algorithms for HTN handling should be proposed for the optimal benefit of cancer patients.  </p>
