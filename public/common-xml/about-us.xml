	<p>Bentham Science is a science, technology, and medical (STM) publisher, providing academic researchers and industrial professionals with the latest information in diverse fields of science and technology. Our peer-reviewed scholarly journals and books have an ever-increasing readership of millions of researchers worldwide.</p>
	<p>Bentham Science currently publishes more than 100 journals in both electronic and printed formats. Our journals cover various disciplines in pharmaceutical research and development, medical subspecialties, engineering, technology, and social sciences. The journals are indexed in recognized indexing agencies, such as Journal Citation Reports/Science Edition, MEDLINE/Index Medicus, PubMed, Scopus, Chemical Abstracts, and EMBASE.</p>
	<p>Forty Bentham Science journals have received impact factor rankings in the annual Journal Citation Report.

	<p>Bentham Science follows the single blind peer-review procedure for submissions of all manuscripts to its journals, except for a selected number of patent journals where double blind review is followed.</p>
	<p>All submitted articles/eBook chapters are subjected to an extensive peer review in consultation with members of the journal’s editorial board and independent external referees (usually three reviewers). All manuscripts/chapters are assessed rapidly and the decision based on all the peer reviewers’ comments, taken by the journal’s Editor-in-Chief/eBook Editor, is then conveyed to the author(s).</p>
	<p>In order to honor the essential role reviewers play in maintaining the integrity and accuracy of research, Bentham Science has partnered with Publon. Publon provides formal recognition to our peer reviewers by producing a verified record of their peer review and editorial contributions for academic journals.

	<p>Besides our wide range of scientific journals, Bentham Science also has a book publishing program, catering to publishing of print and electronic books on diverse themes. Bentham takes pride in publishing more than 800 books so far, with a reasonable number in the process of publication. We continue to broaden our publishing scope, by expanding our books and journals catalog annually, to also include works relevant to emerging disciplines.

	<p>Bentham Science offers a reliable publishing experience to authors from the initial manuscript submission till the final publication, through our state of the art journal management system which makes the publication process smooth and timely. With a productive association of 10,000 eminent scientists on the editorial boards, (including Nobel laureates as honorary advisors), Bentham Science provides high-quality peer review services to maintain their standards in publication.</p>
	<p>In addition to publication opportunities for researchers, we also offer scholarly content licensing solutions, through our online store Eureka Select, to academic and corporate libraries interested in our journals and books. The online store also make our publications available for individual readers and publishers.
