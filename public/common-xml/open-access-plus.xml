        <title>Open access Plus</title>
        <p>After receiving acceptance of the submitted manuscript, the corresponding author is offered the option of <italic>Open Access Plus</italic>, which entails payment of a certain fee to make the published article freely available online via the journalsâ€™ website.  Publication as open access allows the widest possible dissemination of the paper to scientists all over the world even if they do not subscribe to the journal. If an author, however, does not choose to pay the open access publication charge, then their article will be published with the standard subscription-based access at no cost. <italic>Open Access Plus</italic> articles are clearly indicated on the journal's online contents page.</p>
