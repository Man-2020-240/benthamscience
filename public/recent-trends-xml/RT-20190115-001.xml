        <p>Many studies have shown that the mechanism of drug-induced myocardial conditioning is enzyme-mediated through messenger RNA and miRNA regulation. In this study Orriach et al. investigated the role that miRNAs play in the cardio-protective effect of halogenated anesthetics, which are widely used in cardiac surgery. The study includes a literature review of the expression profile of miRNAs in ischemic conditions and in the complications which were prevented by these phenomena.</p>
        <p>To identify miRNAs involved in anesthetic-induced myocardial conditioning, a review was conducted of more than 100 studies. The expression is modulated by the perioperative administration of halogenated anesthetics. This is the first study of its kind.</p>
        <p>For future research in the field of cardiology, the potential of miRNAs as biomarkers and miRNAs-based therapies involving the synthesis, inhibition or stimulation of miRNAs stand out as a promising avenue. The cardio-protective effects of myocardial conditioning are related to the expression of several miRNAs. New therapeutic and diagnostic opportunities come across as cumulative evidence of miRNAs playing a role in heart disease and myocardial conditioning is revealed. While further research is needed in this direction, these studies provide new grounds for the development of new hypnotic/anesthetic agents for cardiac surgery patients.</p>
