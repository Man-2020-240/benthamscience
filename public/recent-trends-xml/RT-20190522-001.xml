<p>The gene most often associated with risk of Alzheimer&apos;s Disease impacts sleep depending on gender and the severity of Alzheimer&apos;s in a patient, suggests a study led by researchers at the Keenan Research Centre for Biomedical Science (KRCBS).</p>
<p>Selected as an Editor&apos;s Choice article by Current Alzheimer Research, this work examined the relationship of abnormal sleep behavior to Apolipoprotein (APOE) &#x03B5;4 allele and to the lesions in the brain responsible for the symptoms of this disease. APOE &#x03B5;4 allele has previously been established as the major risk factor for Alzheimer&apos;s disease.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that one effect of this gene variant is to alter sleep prior to the development of Alzheimer&apos;s disease. These findings are consistent with previous evidence on the effect of this gene.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an important topic to explore further because sleep disturbances constitute a major disruption for caregivers of patients with Alzheimer&apos;s Disease,&quot; said Dr. David Munoz, project investigator at the KRCBS. &quot;It has also been proposed that alterations in sleep drive the development of Alzheimer&apos;s disease.&quot;</p>
<p>The researchers found the effects of the gene studied are seen in women only. In elderly patients without Alzheimer&apos;s disease, carriers of APOE &#x03B5;4 have significantly more nighttime disturbances than non-carriers.</p>
<p>As a next step, Dr. Munoz and his team will look into the timeline of sleep disturbances throughout the development of Alzheimer&apos;s, along with the timing of declines in cognitive testing.</p>
